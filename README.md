### An Interesting Article

Recently for my Social Networking class, I read an article about [the Netflix Prize](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/the-netflix-prize) that I found to be really interesting. I don't even think I remember hearing about this competition growing up, so to learn about an event where a big company held such an exciting and rigorous coding competition was really cool. 

What was also interesting to me was that Netflix released such a big quantity of data for developers to work on and developers of all ages and experiences were willing to give it a try. It was also nice to read that the prize money of ***$1 million*** was donated by the winning team. However, after the first competition ended and the comapny wanted to host a sequel, the data that they released was deemed a violation of privacy and there was never another competition quite like it.
